* About Me
Welcome to my github. I am *very* into machine learning and specifically natural language processing.
* Publications
If you're interested on my work in NLP research, checkout my work on [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OWSQqZMAAAAJ&hl=en][Google Scholar]] or [[https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Brian-Lester/144104130][Semantic Scholar]].
* My software
In my opinion a lot of current research skates over details and many small bug creep into the work. At worse this can change results and at best it means what you implemented is not what you actually described. A common source of these errors in NLP research is padding, you can see the slides of a talk I have about it [[https://github.com/blester125/A2D-NLP-Talk-Feb-27-2020/blob/master/Your-Neural-Network-Is-Probably-Wrong.pdf][here]].

In the interest of fixing these sorts of problem, and my general belief in open source software, I have a collection of small, (hopefully) well-engineered, tools that will help facilitate reuse where these sorts of error have already been accounted for.
